            <p>
                No matter what you business, your customers are going to want to know two
                things.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What do you have to offer?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Why should I or my business care?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                My copy will answer both of those questions.
            </p>
            <div>
                <strong>
                    It gets their attention. And it builds rapport
                </strong>
            </div>
            <br />
            <p>
                Before anything else you have to get noticed. You need copy that
                tells your customer something that they never heard before. Or it tells
                them what they know or think they know, but in a way that shows them
                their problem in a different light.
            </p>
            <p>My copy shows them that you're solution is their solution</p>

            <p>
                But rather than just have me tell you what I can do, let me show you. I
                have samples on this site that you can look at. Send me any marketing
                piece-ad, brochure, sales letter, white paper, etc. I’ll send you back an
                analysis of what’s right, what could be better, and what I would do. I also
                work on spec. I will be happy to write something up that will give you an idea of the style and direction I'll use.
                So get in touch and let me know what you're trying to achieve.
            </p>
            <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

        <article style="font-size:16px">


            <p>I received a BA in English with a concentration in Technical Communications from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. I was writing way before I ever set foot in college. I guess that's the way it is for many of us. In addition to articles for the local paper, I wrote fiction here and there. I've always been interested in and passionate about the written word. </p>

            <p>I've been a software developer for a number of years so I have an interest in technology. I worked mostly with the Microsoft technology stack: C#, ASP.NET, </p>

            <p>Technology doesn't scare me.</p>
            <p>And neither does a blank page.</p>

            <p>I like words. I don't like wasting them. I like saying things in the quickest, most efficient way possible.</p>
            <p>Cause life's too short.</p>
            <p>I'm sure you and your customers would agree.</p>

                                I met this lady-I’ll call her Linda- who was an aspiring author. She wrote and submitted fifteen romance novels to publishers. All fifteen were rejected.

                            I’ve been writing since eighth grade. I remember when it all started. I had written an essay and the teacher complimented my paper and encouraged me to keep it up. Suffice it to say, the teacher was young and pretty and I was hooked.

                            I kept it up and ended up getting a degree in English. But did I end up as a writer? Not really. The writing jobs that I ended up with after college were interesting, but the pay didn’t even cover rent. I got discouraged and tired of struggling. I ended
                            up getting a job that had nothing to do with writing but paid way better than what I was making before.

            <p>
                There's more to University of Tennessee football than 22 guys dressed in helmets and pads, half of them dressed in orange and white, charging into one another. Football also includes cheerleaders, hours before the game, lining up in the bright autumn sun; band members fingering their instruments; bored gatekeepers, waiting for a ticket to tear and kids throwing pompoms at one another.
                In More than the Game, Robert Heller, UT Professor of photojournalism, captured life around the playing field that is in many ways just as vivid as the game itself.
                "I was always fascinated with the pageantry in all the major aspects of college football," Heller said.
            </p>
            <p>
                Heller pursued that interest here at UT where the school extended Heller the courtesy of a field pass and allowed him to photograph whatever he wanted.
                "I found that over the 15 years that I've been here, I've built up quite a collection of photographs that I believe are rather unique," he said. Heller estimates that for More than the Game he took between 5,000 and 7,000 pictures and from those, less than 150 made it into the book.
            </p>
            <p>
                As to what criteria used to judge the pictures, Heller said, "I look at the composition of the photograph, the color, the point of view. I chose those pictures which were visually compelling to me...anything that might make a good picture is what I am interested in," Heller said.
                More than the Game was not true photojournalism in the sense that it focused solely on the experiences of the people and events the photos displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It was my interpretation as an artist of the UT football experience," Heller said. "As the title suggests, the book is about everything that surrounds the game."
                Heller's book neatly divides the pictures into eight broad areas - "The Fans," "The Band," "The Cheerleaders," "The Stadium," "The Officials," "The Players," "The Coaches," and, interesting enough, "The Media." With a grin on his face, Heller said that he further subdivided those categories and labeled them with titles not found in the book.
                For instance, Heller unofficially calls pages 48-49 "the yelling page." It shows three individuals in orange, screaming at the action below them. Pages 40-41 is the "face painted page" showing three individuals faces painted in white and orange.
            </p>
            <p>
                Patterns figure predominantly in the book. Indeed, much of Heller's work consists of careful editing as much as it does on photography. "More than the Game is a book of pictures making patterns as much as it is a book of pictures themselves. Whether it was a row of tubas lined up like little a row of mouths waiting to be fed or a row of cheerleaders who each have a big orange "T" painted on the same spot on her face, patterns find their way into the book.
                "Sometimes it's interesting to have a close-up of one person, but sometimes its interesting to photograph a series of people wearing the same uniform, and kinda what happens to them," Heller said. "I mean, how can you go wrong taking a picture of tubas, they're so interesting, and when you have a row of them they're even more interesting."
                One of the most interesting features about the book is the way Heller often grouped the photos together so that for attentive readers the photos would take on meanings outside of themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I had a chance to not only do the photography and the editing, but the design as well," he said. "That's kinda nice because when you're working with your own work, you want to present it the best way you can."
                Heller went on to point out a number of places where he arranged his photos for a humorous effect. In one part of the book, Heller juxtaposes a picture of the actor David Keith (who, according to Heller, has been granted status as an "honorary coach") dressed as a coach above a picture of coach Phillip Fulmer.In another section there are two pictures of people placed side by side, so as they appear to be looking at one another -- one through a camcorder, the other through a pair of binoculars. Another set of pictures in the "Officials" section shows a picture of an official's cap above the picture of another official's waist which leads to a third picture on the next page of an official's arm. "It's as if what's missing is the face," Heller said. "It's kind of an amusing thing to have fun with," he added.
            </p>
            <p>
                When asked how the book was selling, Heller replied "I don't know...the bookstore tells me it's selling well, and that there's a big market for this kind of book." Heller said that he is currently working on making portraits of Holocaust survivors accompanied by handwritten accounts of their experiences.
                When asked what advice he had for emerging photographers interested in publishing their own books, Heller said, "Do your work because you have a passion for your work, not because you're trying sell a book or make money. When you have sizable amount of work that you think there's a market for, put it together in a coherent fashion. Do your research, find someone who might publish your work and send them a proposal. You never know."

            You don't have to be a rocket scientist to appreciate the University of Tennessee Space Institute.<p>
            <p> Technology paving the way for more fuel efficient cars, realistic special effects for Hollywood and possible new defenses against bioterrorism have been developed by researchers in this quiet corner of Middle Tennessee.</p>
            <p>
                For Dr. John Caruthers, Chief Operating Officer and Dean for Academic Affairs, it is the people as much as the facilities that have made UTSI what it is today.
            <p>
                "We have individuals from all over the world who are the best in their field working here," Caruthers said.
            <p>
                Unfortunately, this gem has seen better days. Big-money government contracts have dried up, the student population has fallen from a high of 350 to fewer than 100 and legislators, faced with a dwindling state budget, have questioned the importance and feasibility of keeping the institute open.
            <p>
                Few questioned UTSI's importance when it officially opened in 1964, when the country was in the middle of the space race with the Soviet Union. During that decade, UTSI lived up to its name, contributing to mankind's first lunar landing in 1969.
            <p>
                The idea for UTSI actually dates further back to the end of World War II when U.S. officials, after seeing how advanced German aviation was, decided that the United States needed to do something similar.
            <p>
                "It was really scary," Caruthers said. "The Germans had developed their theories and practical applications of supersonic flight to the point where, if they had waited a few years before starting the war ... we would have been in big trouble."
            <p>
                According to Caruthers, the Nazis succeeded in part because of the way they placed manufacturing centers close to technical schools, allowing professors and advanced students to apply their research quickly to a manufacturing environment. The famous aerodynamist, Theodore von Karman, recommended that the U.S. should build facilities to expand upon Nazi research and to associate those facilities with a university.
            <p>
                In 1964, UTSI began operation under the directorship of B.H. Goethert, a German scientist who worked under the Nazis during World War II. During the Cold War, UTSI assisted the Air Engineering Development Corporation in testing and developing aircraft and spacecraft design.
            <p>
                After the Berlin Wall fell, defense funding began to dry up and UTSI researchers started looking for civilian applications for UTSI research.
            <p>
                The civilian applications included methods for making better metal alloys to finding ways to make a softball travel faster and farther.
            <p>
                Biophysics is where some of the most exciting work is being done today. According to Caruthers, a UTSI researcher has developed a device that uses short laser bursts to read the genetic code of an individual. Such a device would be extremely useful in medicine, Caruthers said.
            <p>
                "We would have the entire code of a person. If someone were to walk into a doctor's office for a blood test ... we might be able to say to that person 'Man, if you live to this age, you will have a genetic predisposition for this or that. But if you address it now, you will have no problem.'"
            <p>
                UTSI research has even made it onto the silver screen. Recently, Hollywood has used UTSI researcher Dr. John Steinhoff's groundbreaking work in air flow modeling. Originally, Steinhoff's work was directed towards helping aircraft designers eliminate the whirlwind vortexes that form behind jet airplanes in flight. Steinhoff took the same technology that he used to model air flow around helicopter blades and aircraft wings, and applied it towards a problem area in the special effects world - creating realistic smoke.
            <p>
                People doing computer generated special effects are not physicists and the smoke they create looks more like a blob than a column of smoke, Steinhoff said. The producers of Jurassic Park III and The Mummy Returns used Steinhoff's methods to create smoke-filled scenes.
            <p>
                UTSI's success relies on its ability to produce cutting-edge research. But such research requires two things: money and talent. And for years, UTSI has been running low on both, especially after losing a major NASA contract several years ago.
            <p>
                "Losing the NASA contract hurt," Caruthers said.
            <p>
                As a result of having less money, he has had to make lots of changes.
            <p>
                "I've consolidated positions ... had to let some staff and non tenured faculty go."
            <p>
                According to Caruthers, the area where the lack of money really hurts is in attracting more talent.
            <p>
                "We don't have the money to invest in young new professors. UTSI has many professors who are tenured and close to retirement," Caruthers said.
            <p>
                Most of these professors are very experienced in the subjects they teach, but they don't necessarily produce the kind of research that attracts funding.
            <p>
                "A lot of the professors here work in traditional aerodynamics," Caruthers said. "We need younger professors doing research in more cutting edge research ... in space technology and health physics, for instance."
            <p>
                Caruthers believes that most of UTSI funding problems can be solved. He envisions a "cooperative" environment where UTSI will take on research oriented faculty and graduate students who will work under them. Graduate students who need classes at UT proper can take those classes via television or the Internet, eliminating the need to move professors not directly involved in institute research to the campus.
            <p>
                At the present the future of UTSI is unclear.
            <p>
                Dr. John Prados, a professor in the College of Engineering, is chairing a committee looking into the future of UTSI.
            <p>
                Prados said that the committee is in the information gathering stage at the moment.
            <p>
                "At this point in time, we haven't even formulated the recommendations ... but my guess is that there would have to be some consolidations and shifting of personnel."
            <p>
                But according to Dr. Loren Crabtree, provost and vice president for Academic Affairs and the person who the committee is reporting to, "All options are open ... We will work with the UTSI leadership to make it a more viable institution."
            <p>
                Like Prados, Crabtree is waiting on the committee to make its recommendations.
            <p>
                "We'll see where it takes us," Crabtree said.
            <p>
                Caruthers remains optimistic on future of UTSI.
            <p>
                "We have the opportunity to do something very special ... and build a renowned institution ... I'm looking to take advantage of that," Caruthers said.

        <h2>Center helps patients with AIDS | The Daily Beacon</h2>



        <article>
            <p> Hope for AIDS victims lives on the seventh floor of Fort Sanders Medical Center, according to Dr. Jeannie Gillian. "People with AIDS have choices; you either sit down or pick up the baton and start marching," said Gillian, director of services for the Hope Center. <p>
                The Hope Center helps people who have found out that they are HIV positive and guides them through the turbulent waters of living with AIDS. The center was established in 1996 following a two year study conducted by Dr. Gillian designed to find out how a group of men and women living with the virus "experienced hope," Gillian said.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of the center, as expressed in an information packet the center puts out, "is to educate and care for AIDS victims and their families in a professional environment, free from judgment."
            <p>
                It's important to distinguish HIV and AIDS: HIV is the presence of the virus in the body and AIDS refers to the disease when it manifests itself by way of symptoms.
            <p>
                In fact, Gillian rarely uses the word AIDS when describing a patient's condition since more live longer with the disease than with AIDS. "Now we use the term HIV disease - we don't use the word AIDS because we don't know if they have AIDS," she said. "Living with HIV disease is no different than living with cancer, leukemia, heart disease, or diabetes."
            <p>
                Still, life does become more complicated whether one is simply HIV positive or they have the full-blown version of the disease. "Survival skills" are needed, Gillian said. "You need to learn about the illness, and the medical conditions surrounding the illness," Gillian said.
            <p>
                One woman found out how much she had to learn about the disease. "I was a normal person ... I never thought it would happen to us," said Carol Ann McMillan, whose brother, Charles "Chucky" Moyers, died of AIDS after several years of being HIV positive.
            <p>
                According to McMillan, Dr. Gillian did everything from helping the McMillans interact with the myriad doctors and medical professionals the family encountered while Moyers was sick to providing emotional support to Moyers and his family. "Dr. Gillian really comes into play with people when everything is at it's worst," she said.
            <p>
                Other people have given praises to Dr. Gillian, like Jack Moore, a volunteer at the center who is HIV positive. "If you have a question, you call Dr. Gillian. If there's a crisis, you call Dr. Gillian ... Jeannie and the Hope Center - they advocate for their clients," he said.
            <p>
                Despite the fact that people still believe AIDS to be a "gay disease" it isn't. "More heterosexuals, especially women, are affected by it," Gillian said. "That's what the disease does, it catches people off guard. People think that they're not going to catch it because they're not a white gay man, and that's the horror of it because you can't get people to understand that it's a medical problem, it's a public health problem."
            <p>
                Gillian mentioned talking to a young man years ago who had AIDS. "He was athletic, attractive," she said. "He told me that he could have had sex here every night of the week. He said that he asked this girl one time 'Aren't you concerned about getting anything' and she told him 'Why no, you don't look like you would have anything.'"
            <p>
                Gillian said that fortunately the young man, who was gay, never did have sex with any of the girls.
            <p>
                And so given the widespread ignorance of HIV and AIDS on campus and in the community, the center places a lot of emphasis on educating the public about the disease. Gillian herself lectures at UT, and is surprised at how little students know about the subject.
            <p>
                "They don't have a clue," Gillian said. "I have to start from the beginning: 'What is HIV; how do you find out if you have HIV; how long does it take before you get sick? I have to answer all of these basic, high school-type questions."
            <p>
                Along with Gillian's guest lectures, the center hosts workshops, and participates in events that focus on building AIDS and HIV awareness. One big project in particular is the NAMES Project, a quilt built by family members and friends who contribute a panel at a time in memory of a person who succumbed to the disease.
            <p>
                But for Gillian, HIV or AIDS education should be more basic than any event or community workshop. "We teach our kids to look both ways before crossing the street ... we should be teaching them how to have safe sex," Gillian said.<article></article>

            <p align="center"><h2>Selling Your Business Using Your Story</h2></p>

            <p>
                Sometime in 2010, journalist Rob Walker took cheaply purchased objects-the
                objects averaged $1.25 apiece- and gave each over to a writer who then created a story around the object. The idea was that the story would give the object greater significance than it would have otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                To test the theory out, each object was sold on eBay.
            </p>
            <p>
                The eBay description included the story of the object. In addition, buyers were told explicitly that the story was fictitious. Let me repeat, the buyers knew prior to buying each object that the object's story was made up! But buyers scooped up the objects for the asking price, regardless.
            </p>
            <p>
                So how did the objects do? The Project reports that $128.74 worth of junk sold for $3,612.51. That's easily over a thousand percent profit! What was the only difference between these objects and stuff you would find at your local yard sale?
            </p>
            <p>
                A story.
            </p>

            <p align="center">
                <strong>Why Your Business Need Stories and Brands</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Stories are the heart of content marketing. What do they do?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        · They get your customer's attention
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        · They help you define a customer's problem and tell the customer how your
                        product or service solves their problem.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>
                Today the marketplace has become busier than ever. Thanks to the internet and companies like Amazon and Alibaba, there are more products and companies selling those products than ever. If you have a credit card and decent amount of credit you can find a supplier that will sell you XYZ
                product in bulk that you can turn around and sell at a markup. As can your competitor.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then the sales go to whoever has the lowest price. And that's fine-if
                you are Walmart, Lowes, whoever.
            </p>
            <p>
                If can't compete on price, you have to compete in some other way. One way is to differentiate your product. In other words, my competitor is selling XYZ while I'm selling XYZ with a twist.
            </p>
            <p>
                How do you create that twist? With a story.
            </p>
            <p align="center">
                <strong>A story says it all</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                What is a story? It's the relationship between someone and their circumstances as that someone tries to solve a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I was out hunting and was attacked by a saber-toothed tiger. Using this little trick I know
                and a little luck, I got away" said one cave man to another, many thousands
                of years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have all this clutter-soap, shampoo, towels- in my shower! I was beside myself until I got the best shower caddy ever. And a great deal to boot!"
                says one parent to another in modern America.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of the statements above is the kernel of a story. Each has a
                protagonist-the person telling the story, and a plot or series of events that outlined the problem and solution. Stories have been around since the dawn of humanity, and in today's world, most of us spend our lives either hearing or telling stories or both.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why? Entertainment, obviously. But stories also do something else. The one caveman listens to the other tell his story of missing the saber tooth tiger. As that caveman listens he imagines what he would do if he were in the same situation. The friend listens to the parent's solution to a
                domestic dilemma. As they listen, they also imagine their own problems and apply the teller of the tale's solution to their own.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, stories help us survive and thrive. Every second, eleven million pieces of information flood our senses. We can process maybe forty of those pieces at any given moment. What about other animals? Most don't bother.
                They rely on what we know as reflexes or instincts. Instincts enable animals to do mainly what psychologists sometimes call the "four fs":  feeding, fighting, fleeing, and… mating.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the lives of us humans are obviously way more complex. We form deep relationships with friends and family, write poetry and math theorems,
                build structures and businesses. The various enterprise people take on require focus, forming priorities, and making decisions. How does someone take over eleven million pieces of information and use that to build a
                house, a business, or a non-profit organization?
            </p>
            <p>
                They use stories. "I want a house that is three thousand square feet, has a
                dine in kitchen and sits on enough land where I can put my vegetable garden
                and start a beehive."
            </p>
            <p>
                "I have this great idea for a business. If I could get business to follow
                my system they would save so much money All I need is some capital- an
                investor or two. know this guy-I need to set up a meeting"
            </p>
            <p>
                "The world would be a better place if we had more people and attention given to this cause. "
            </p>
            <p>
                Or.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This is given me so much problem. I can't believe someone hasn't invented
                something to take care of this for me!"
            </p>
            <p>
                Or.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This problem is really putting a crimp on production. It might be worth it
                to somebody to get someone or something
            </p>
            <p align="center">
                <strong>See Your Customer's Story Your Own</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Humans work through problems using stories. If you can craft a story that coincides with the problem in their story then you can create interest and an angle for what you're selling. In turn, that will arouse the curiosity of a potential customer and hopefully lead to a sale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's say you own an airplane and you have a small business flying customers around to cities in your region. It costs way more to fly with you than it does a regular airline. You only fly certain areas, and you don't fly twenty-four seven. But there are smaller charter airlines and private pilots who offer the same service. They fly in the same region and the same routes as you.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have to differentiate yourself. How?
            </p>
            <p>
                Your business performs the same service as many other similar businesses,
                but it is not the same as other businesses. What is the difference?
            </p>
            <p>
                You. And the way you explain that difference is through a story.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's say you've always wanted to be a pilot. Maybe you started flying when you were young in like the Civil Air Patrol, you flew in the service, flew as a missionary bush pilot, or maybe you went to school somewhere and trained, whatever. It doesn't matter what your history is, you just have to tie it into the problem the customer has. Let's say you started out training at an aerospace college somewhere and eventually worked for an airline.
            </p>
            <p>
                But you hated working for the airlines. The bureaucracy, the waits, the hassle with passengers who had issues that you had no control over as an employee of a company. You noted all the things that passengers hate about flying: long waits, cramped seats, layovers, etc. You came up with a
                solution and executed it. Now, your air service carries passengers point to point, no hassle waiting, and they can walk out of the terminal to the plane. As a plus, you're personable and get along well with people.
            </p>
            <p>
                And there, Mr. Ex Airline-now-CEO-of-your-own-charter-business, there's your story. You the protagonist saw a problem, and you came to the rescue and fixed it. More importantly, in your marketing, you reveal a
                little about yourself during your story. You like people and want to help them get where they're going quickly and comfortably. That builds rapport and makes you a person-different from any other pilot or service out.
                Because as you and I know, there is no other person like you.
            </p>
            <p>
                And you are the only one who can tell your story. That's on you.
