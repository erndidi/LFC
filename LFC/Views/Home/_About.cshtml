    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I received a BA in English with a concentration in Technical Communications from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. I was writing way before I ever set foot in college. I guess that's the way it is for many of us. In addition to articles for the local paper, I wrote fiction here and there. I've always been interested in and passionate about the written word. </p>

    <p>I've been a software developer for a number of years so I have an interest in technology.</p>

    <p>Technology doesn't scare me.</p>
    <p>And neither does a blank page.</p>

    <p>I like words. I don't like wasting them. I like saying things in the quickest, most efficient way possible.</p>
    <p>Cause life's too short.</p>
    <p>I'm sure you and your customers would agree.</p>
