        <p>
            No matter what you business, your customers are going to want to know two
            things.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                What do you have to offer?
            </li>
            <li>
                Why should I or my business care?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            My copy will answer both of those questions.
        </p>

            Before anything else you have to get noticed. You need copy that
            tells your customer something that they never heard before. Or it tells
            them what they know or think they know, but in a way that shows them
            their problem in a different light. It shows how your solution solves that problem.
        </p>
        <p>My copy shows them that you're solution is their solution</p>

            But rather than just have me tell you what I can do, let me show you. I
            have samples on this site that you can look at. Send me any marketing
            piece-ad, brochure, sales letter, white paper, etc. I’ll send you back an
            analysis of what’s right, what could be better, and what I would do. I also
            work on spec. I will be happy to write something up that will give you an idea of the style and direction I'll use.
            So get in touch and let me know what you're trying to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
