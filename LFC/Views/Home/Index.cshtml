    <p>No matter what you sell, and who sell it to, your customers are going to want to know two things.</p>

    <p>What do you have to sell?</p>

    <p>Why should I or my business care?</p>

    <p>I can help you answer both of those questions for your customers. If you need to introduce your productive or service or update existing customers, an email campaign is a good way to do that. I can help with that. </p>

    <p>Email letters, web copy, white papers are ways to get in front of customers- and stay there. </p>

    <p>But rather than just have me tell you that I can help, let me show you. Send me any marketing piece-ad, brochure, sales letter, white paper. And I’ll send you back an analysis of what’s right, what could be better, and what I would do. I also do work on spec.

    <p>Email me here, Ernest Lipford at leapforward@gmail.com. </p>

    <p>I look forward to hearing from you. </p>
