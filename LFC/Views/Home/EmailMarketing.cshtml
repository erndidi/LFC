            <div>
                I met this lady-I’ll call her Linda- who was an aspiring author. She wrote and submitted fifteen romance novels to publishers. All fifteen were rejected.
            </div>

                <br />
            </div>
            <div>
                The lady told me then that she was working on her sixteenth novel. And she was going to submit that one as well. I don’t know if sixteen was the magic number or not, but -way to push, there Linda!
            </div>
            <div>
                Would you put yourself through that? I know I wouldn't. I don't expect many of us would.

                I’ve been writing since eighth grade. I remember when it all started. I had written an essay and the teacher complimented my paper and encouraged me to keep it up. Suffice it to say, the teacher was young and pretty and I was hooked.
            </div>

            <div>
                I kept it up and ended up getting a degree in English. But did I end up as a writer? Not really. The writing jobs that I ended up with after college were interesting, but the pay didn’t even cover rent. I got discouraged and tired of struggling. I ended
                up getting a job that had nothing to do with writing but paid way better than what I was making before.
